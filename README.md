Join me as I dig into how big data, and machine learning technologies can help solve real world problems. Coming from a non technical background I understand how frustrating It can be to learn Tech skills, without a proper roadmap. here I share daily tips on how to make this journey simple and straightforward  :pencil:









# Get Started :pushpin:
Figure out what you need to learn, Get comfortable with Python, Learn data analysis, manipulation, and visualization with python libaries (Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn), Learn machine learning with scikit-learn, Understand machine learning model types and use cases (Regression, binary classification.. etc), You become great at it by practicing ðŸ‘‘
